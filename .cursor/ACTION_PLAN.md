# **PressKit Pro \- Strategic Action Plan**

### Phase 0: Foundation & Setup

* **Goal:** Establish a professional development environment and project structure.  
* **Actions:** Create local/GitHub repositories and populate with this full engineering blueprint.

### Phase 1: Backend API Construction

* **Goal:** Build the secure, scalable core of the application.  
* **Key Outcomes:** A fully functional REST API with complete user authentication and data management endpoints. All security best practices from .cursor-rules will be implemented here.

### Phase 2: Web Application (Next.js) Development

* **Goal:** Build the SEO-optimized website and artist dashboard.  
* **Key Outcomes:** A performant, secure, and feature-complete web application that consumes the backend API. All SEO mandates from .cursor-rules will be implemented here.

### Phase 3: Mobile Application (React Native) Development

* **Goal:** Build the native iOS and Android companion apps.  
* **Key Outcomes:** A user-friendly mobile experience for artists to manage their EPKs on the go.

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Security Audit

* **Goal:** Ensure application quality, stability, and security before public exposure.  
* **Actions:**  
  * **Automated Testing:** Execute all unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.  
  * **Manual QA:** Perform thorough manual testing of all user flows on all platforms.  
  * **Security Audit:** Conduct a full security review, including dependency scanning (npm audit), penetration testing simulations, and checking against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.  
  * **Performance Baselining:** Run performance audits (Lighthouse) to ensure the web app meets Core Web Vitals targets.

### Phase 5: Beta Testing & User Feedback

* **Goal:** Gather real-world user feedback for final refinements.  
* **Actions:**  
  * **Closed Beta:** Invite a select group of artists to use the platform.  
  * **Feedback Collection:** Systematically gather bug reports and feature requests.  
  * **Iteration:** Implement critical fixes and high-value improvements based on feedback.

### Phase 6: Production Deployment & Monitoring

* **Goal:** Launch the platform to the public and ensure its ongoing health.  
* **Actions:**  
  * **Deployment:** Deploy the backend, web app, and submit mobile apps to stores.  
  * **Monitoring:** Set up logging, error tracking (e.g., Sentry), and uptime monitoring for the production environment.
