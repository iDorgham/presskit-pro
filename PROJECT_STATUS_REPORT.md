## üö® **Action Required: Fix Your MongoDB Password**

The test script detected that your `MONGODB_URI` still contains `<db_password>`. Here's how to fix it:

### **Step 1: Get Your MongoDB Atlas Password**

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Navigate to **Database Access** (in the left sidebar under "Security")
4. Find your user `press-dorgham` or create a new database user
5. If you need to reset the password, click **Edit** ‚Üí **Edit Password**
6. Copy the new password

### **Step 2: Update Your .env File**

Open `server/.env` and replace this line:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://press-dorgham:<db_password>@presskit-pro.ayb51wk.mongodb.net/
```

With your actual password:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://press-dorgham:YOUR_ACTUAL_PASSWORD@presskit-pro.ayb51wk.mongodb.net/presskit-pro
```

**Note:** I added `/presskit-pro` at the end to specify the database name.

### **Step 3: Test Again**

After updating the password, run the test again:

```powershell
npx ts-node src/test-db.ts
```

### **Step 4: Start Your Server**

Once the database connection works, you can start your server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Then test these endpoints:
- **Health Check:** http://localhost:5000/api/health
- **Database Test:** http://localhost:5000/api/db-test

## üìã **Additional Setup (if needed)**

### **If you get connection errors:**

1. **Whitelist Your IP Address:**
   - In MongoDB Atlas ‚Üí Network Access
   - Add your current IP address or use `0.0.0.0/0` for development (not recommended for production)

2. **Check Your Cluster Status:**
   - In MongoDB Atlas ‚Üí Database
   - Ensure your cluster is running (not paused)

### **Alternative: Use a Local MongoDB**

If you prefer to use a local MongoDB instance:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/presskit-pro-dev
```

## üéØ **What Happens After You Fix The Password**

Once you update the password and run the test, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured
- ‚úÖ Database connection established  
- ‚úÖ Database operations working
- ‚úÖ User model functioning correctly
- ‚úÖ Password hashing and validation working

Your MongoDB connection will then be fully operational and ready for development!

Would you like me to help you with anything else once you've updated the password?
