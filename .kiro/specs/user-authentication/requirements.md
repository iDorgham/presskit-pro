# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Authentication & Tier Management system provides secure user registration, login, and subscription tier management for PressKit Pro. This system enables artists to create accounts, authenticate securely, and access features based on their subscription tier (Free, Premium, or Pro). The system must handle user data securely, provide seamless authentication across web and mobile platforms, and manage subscription upgrades/downgrades with proper access control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an artist, I want to create a secure account with my email and password, so that I can access the PressKit Pro platform and build my EPK.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid email and strong password THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with Free tier access
2. WHEN a user provides an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating the email is already registered
3. WHEN a user provides an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL return a validation error with specific formatting requirements
4. WHEN a user provides a weak password THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with password strength requirements (minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
5. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL send a verification email to confirm the email address
6. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN the system SHALL activate the account and redirect to the dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered artist, I want to securely log into my account using my email and password, so that I can access my EPK dashboard and manage my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and provide access to their dashboard
2. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return an error message without revealing whether the email or password was incorrect
3. WHEN a user fails to login 5 times within 15 minutes THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 30 minutes
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure JWT token with appropriate expiration time
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login page and require re-authentication
6. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the JWT token and clear all session data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an artist, I want to reset my password if I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account without losing my EPK data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send a secure reset link to their registered email address
2. WHEN a user clicks a valid reset link within 1 hour THEN the system SHALL allow them to set a new password
3. WHEN a user clicks an expired or invalid reset link THEN the system SHALL display an error and offer to send a new reset link
4. WHEN a user successfully resets their password THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing sessions and require fresh login
5. WHEN a user sets a new password THEN the system SHALL enforce the same password strength requirements as registration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an artist, I want to access different features based on my subscription tier (Free, Premium, Pro), so that I can upgrade when I need more advanced functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Free tier user accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL limit them to 3 photo galleries, 5 music tracks, and standard templates
2. WHEN a Premium tier user accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL provide unlimited content, custom domains, and advanced analytics
3. WHEN a Pro tier user accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL provide all Premium features plus team collaboration, custom CSS, and integration APIs
4. WHEN a user attempts to access tier-restricted features THEN the system SHALL display an upgrade prompt with clear pricing information
5. WHEN a user's subscription expires THEN the system SHALL downgrade their access to Free tier while preserving their data
6. WHEN a user upgrades their tier THEN the system SHALL immediately grant access to new features without requiring re-login

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an artist, I want to manage my account settings and subscription, so that I can update my information and control my billing preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses account settings THEN the system SHALL display current tier, billing information, and account details
2. WHEN a user updates their profile information THEN the system SHALL validate and save the changes with confirmation
3. WHEN a user changes their email address THEN the system SHALL require email verification before updating
4. WHEN a user upgrades their subscription THEN the system SHALL process payment through Stripe and update tier access immediately
5. WHEN a user downgrades their subscription THEN the system SHALL maintain current tier until the end of the billing period
6. WHEN a user cancels their subscription THEN the system SHALL schedule downgrade for the end of the current billing period and send confirmation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure user data is protected and compliant with privacy regulations, so that the platform maintains trust and legal compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt passwords using bcrypt with minimum 12 salt rounds
2. WHEN user data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption for all communications
3. WHEN a user requests data export THEN the system SHALL provide complete account data in JSON format within 30 days
4. WHEN a user requests account deletion THEN the system SHALL permanently delete all personal data within 30 days while preserving anonymized analytics
5. WHEN authentication attempts are made THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring and audit purposes
6. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement progressive delays and temporary blocks to prevent abuse
